# Customer-Segmentation
Performed customer segmentation on the Mall Customers dataset using Python. Conducted EDA, data exploration, clustering, and visualization in Jupyter notebooks to identify key customer groups and generate actionable marketing insights.

## Project Overview
Performed customer segmentation on the Mall Customers dataset (~200 customers) to understand buying behavior and group customers into meaningful segments. The project includes EDA, data exploration, clustering, and visualization using Python in Jupyter notebooks.

## Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step analysis  
K-Means Clustering for segmentation  

## Key Features
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer demographics and spending patterns  
Explored data trends using visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, pair plots)  
Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups  
Created visual summaries of clusters for easy interpretation  

## Insights from Project
Older customers (~54 yrs) with moderate income (~48k) who spend carefully. Best for value-based products.  
Young adults (~33 yrs), high income (~86k), and very high spenders. Most profitable group for luxury/premium marketing.  
Youngest group (~25 yrs), low income (~40k), but moderate spending habits. Good target for discounts and trendy affordable products.  
Mid-aged (~39 yrs), high income (~87k), but very low spending. Need personalized engagement to increase spending.  

## Business Takeaways
Cluster 0 (Mature Moderate Spenders) → Good for value-based marketing.  
Cluster 1 (Young High-Income Big Spenders) → Best group for luxury & premium targeting.  
Cluster 2 (Young Average Spenders) → Can be converted into loyal customers with budget-friendly deals.  
Cluster 3 (High-Income Low Spenders) → Requires strategic engagement to encourage higher spending.  

## How This Project Helped Me
Gained practical experience in data cleaning, exploration, and visualization  
Learned how to apply clustering techniques to real-world data  
Improved ability to translate data insights into actionable business strategies
